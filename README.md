## Docx to Markdown Tool for LLM RAG (Offline Usage) – Inspired by MarkItDown (JavaScript-only)

This Docx to Markdown Tool is a JavaScript-based utility designed for converting DOCX files into Markdown format, specifically crafted for offline use in LLM (Large Language Model) Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Inspired by the MarkItDown project, this tool operates entirely in the browser or locally without the need for a server, ensuring full privacy and security of your documents.

## Key Features:

- Offline Usage: Fully offline, running entirely within your browser or local environment, ensuring that your documents stay private without needing to upload anything to a server.
- Fast and Efficient Conversion: Quickly converts DOCX files into clean, well-structured Markdown, ideal for easy text processing, manipulation, and integration into LLM RAG tasks.
- Preserves Formatting: The conversion retains key formatting elements from the original DOCX file, including headings, lists, bold, italics, and links, providing an accurate Markdown representation.
- JavaScript-Only: Built entirely in JavaScript, with no external dependencies, so it runs smoothly on web-based applications or local environments without additional setups.
- No File Uploads: As all processes are handled locally, there’s no need to upload your sensitive files to any server, ensuring maximum security and privacy.
